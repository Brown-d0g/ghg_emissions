# Step 1

Make a Github repository for your project. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo

I recommend just starting with this repository. You should be able to make a branch or copy the starting code.

# Step 2

Configure your repository to be a github.io page.  Look at "project site".  https://pages.github.com/

# Step 3

Find a data set. I like FEC data, but you don't have to use that.

# Step 4

Create a visualization.  I recommend the following sub-steps:

## Step 4.1

Select and use a data structure to read the data

## Step 4.2

Convert the data structure to a data frame.

## Step 4.3

Use Seaborn to make a data visualization.  To use Seaborn on your personal computer, run "pip install seaborn" at command line.
